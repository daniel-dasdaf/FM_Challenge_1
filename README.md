 Frontend mentor challenge - Product Preview Card Component
-> (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa)

-> There is some problems of the colors not being the same as the design images (i guess)

-> I tried to use FlexBox
-> I know i can work more on optimizing the code, but i'm lazy
